# DataVisualization

According to sas.com, Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns. With interactive visualization, you can take the concept a step further by using technology to drill down into charts and graphs for more detail, interactively changing what data you see and how it’s processed.

The article attached [here](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/big-data/data-visualization.html) explains the **History of DataViz**, **The Current Trend of DataViz**, **How it's Used** and **How it works**

SearchBusiness explains Data Visualization as it relate to Data Science. In their Definition, Data visualization is the practice of translating information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to understand and pull insights from. The main goal of data visualization is to make it easier to identify patterns, trends and outliers in large data sets. The term is often used interchangeably with others, including information graphics, information visualization and statistical graphics.

They provide examples of Visualizations, some use cases in Business and importance. Read in details [here](https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/data-visualization).

## Tools/Libraries to execute data visualization tasks
1. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html)
2. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html)
3. [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)
4. **Bokeh** is an interactive visualization library for modern web browsers. It provides elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics, and affords high-performance interactivity over large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily make interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications. See a live notebook [here to practice withBokeh](https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/bokeh-bokeh-notebooks-ddr2j6yu/notebooks/tutorial/00%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Setup.ipynb)

## Key Topics in Data Visualization
1. Uni-variate Analysis
2. Bi-variate Analysis
3. Multi-variate Analysis

The article [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/05/data-visualization-resource/) explains the different kinds of chart to explore data and provides some examples
1. **Uni-variate Analysis**
  >> Univariate analysis explores each variable in a data set, separately. It looks at the range of values, as well as the central tendency of the values. It describes the pattern of response to the variable. It describes each variable on its own.
    Descriptive statistics describe and summarize data. Univariate descriptive statistics describe individual variables. [learn about uni-variate analysis here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/07/univariate-analysis-visualization-with-illustrations-in-python/) <br> In the article, a walkthrough of how to complete the univariate analysis part of a data visualization process is explained using the hello world dataset of machine learning `iris dataset`.
2. **Bi-variate Analysis**
  >> According to wikipedia, Bivariate analysis is one of the simplest forms of quantitative analysis. It involves the analysis of two variables, for the purpose of determining the empirical relationship between them. Bivariate analysis can be helpful in testing simple hypotheses of association. [The notebook attached here](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/bivariate-plotting-with-pandas) is a kaggle notebook that explains the art of bivariate analysis and also provides various question to solidy the understaning of what has been taught in the notebook. Do well to complete the tasks.
3. **Multi-variate Analysis**
  >> Multivariate (Multidimensional) Visualization. □ Visualization of datasets that have more than three variables.
  In this article, Dipanjan Sarkar (GDE) explains the art of effective viz for multi-dimensional data. [The Art of Effective Visualization of Multi-dimensional Data](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-art-of-effective-visualization-of-multi-dimensional-data-6c7202990c57)
